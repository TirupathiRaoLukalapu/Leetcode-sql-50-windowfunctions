LeetCode SQL 50 — Window Functions Edition




About Me

Hi, my name is Tirupathi Rao Lukalapu, and I am a Data Engineer. I have been solving SQL problems to strengthen my fundamentals and problem-solving skills, especially while actively applying for jobs. This preparation has been extremely helpful during interviews.

Through this process, I have learned a lot — consistency and patience were the keys. I believe advanced SQL topics are crucial for any data professional. Initially, I solved these problems using standard methods, and later I focused on window functions, CTEs, and subqueries wherever possible. This approach has helped me deepen my SQL expertise.

I have structured the repository carefully to include:

Problem statement

Problem approach

SQL solution with advanced techniques

I encourage you to explore the repository. If you are interested in discussing SQL concepts, I am very open to connecting. You can reach out to me on LinkedIn
.

I have spent a lot of time pushing these solutions, and I hope they will be helpful to others. If you find any mistakes, please ping me — I am always happy to learn and engage in discussions to expand my knowledge.
